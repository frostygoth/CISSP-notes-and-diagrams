##Understand and Apply Concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability##

- The three major security principals are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
	+ Confidentiality
		* Confidentiality is the concept of the measures used to ensure the protection of the secrecy of data, objects, or resources.
		* Attacks include capturing network traffic, stealing password files, social engineering, port scanning, shoulder surfing, eavesdropping, sniffing, escalation of privileges.
		* Counter measures include encryption, network traffic padding, strict access control, rigorous authentication procedures, data classification, and extensive personnel training.
		* Other concepts, conditions, and aspects of confidentiality include the following:
			- Sensitivity: Refers to the quality of information, which could cause harm or damage if disclosed.
			- Discretion: An act of decision where an operator can influence or control disclosure in order to minimize harm or damage.
			- Criticality: The level to which information is mission critical. The higher the criticality the more likely the need to maintain the confidentiality.
			- Concealment: The act of hiding something to prevent disclosure. Often concealment is viewed as a means of cover, obfuscation, or distraction.
			- Secrecy: The act of keeping something a secret or preventing the disclosure of information.
			- Privacy: This refers to keeping information confidential that is personally identifiable or that might cause harm, embarrassment, or disgrace to someone if revealed.
			- Seclusion:
			- Isolation:
		

##Chapter Terms##

- Object: The passive element in a security relationship, such as files, computers, network connections, and applications. A subject acts upon or against an object.
- Subject: The active element in a security relationship, such as users, programs, and computers. A subject acts upon or against an object.
- Access Control: The term used to refer to the management of the relationship between subjects and objects.
- Network Traffic Padding: A counter measure meant to protect the confidentiality of a network by inserting dummy traffic into the network to confuse a threat by changing the pattern of network flow.
